I used the following link to create access and secret keys in AWS -> https://k21academy.com/amazon-web-services/create-access-and-secret-keys-in-aws/

These keys are necessary in order to authenticate with AWS from your local machine and be able to make any changes related to your account.

Save the keys according to the best practices.
