Once you saved your keys as a .csv file, install aws cli (if not installed) following the next link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

You can check whether your installation is done properly with the following commands:

which aws
aws --version

Once you made sure that aws cli is installed on your local machine, execute following commands:

aws configure
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="YOUR_REGION"

After executing these commands, you are all set to start provisioning resources on AWS using Terraform on your local machine.
